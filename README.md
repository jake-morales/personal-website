# personal-website

Portfolio website for Jake Morales (Software Engineer). A static HTML/CSS site with work experience, education, and side project pages.

## Tech Stack & Why

### Bulma CSS (v1.0.4)

Bulma is a CSS-only framework installed via npm. It was chosen because:

- **Easy to use** — no JavaScript required, just add CSS classes to HTML elements
- **Easy to install** — one `npm install` and you have the full framework
- **Popular, well-documented stylings** — comes with pre-built components like navbars, hero banners, cards, columns, boxes, tags, and buttons that look professional out of the box

Bulma handles all the responsive layout and component styling. Custom visual enhancements (gradients, shadows, hover animations) are layered on top in `css/custom.css`.

### Font Awesome (v6.5)

Font Awesome icons are loaded via CDN (`<link>` tag in each HTML file). Icons are used throughout the site to make it more visually scannable and professional:

- **Navbar** — home and project icons for quick recognition
- **Work experience & education** — role-specific icons (building, laptop, graduation cap, etc.) next to each entry
- **Tech stack tags** — brand icons for technologies (React, Node.js, Docker, etc.)
- **Buttons** — GitHub, external link, and back arrow icons
- **Footer** — social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jake-morales/personal-website.git
cd personal-website
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Bulma CSS from npm into the `node_modules/` directory.

### 3. Run the build

```bash
npm run build
```

This copies `bulma.min.css` from `node_modules/bulma/css/` into the `css/` directory where the HTML files expect to find it.

### 4. Start a local server

The site uses absolute paths for CSS (e.g., `/css/bulma.min.css`), so you **cannot** open `index.html` directly via `file://` in your browser — the styles won't load.

**Option A — VS Code Live Server (recommended):**

1. Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html` in the VS Code file explorer
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
4. Your browser will open to `http://127.0.0.1:5500` with the site running and live-reloading on file changes

**Option B — Terminal:**

```bash
npx serve .
```

This starts a local static file server. Open the URL it prints (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## How the Build Works

This is a plain static site with **no bundler, no compiler, and no framework**. The only build step is copying one file:

- `package.json` declares one dependency: `bulma`
- The `build` script runs: `cp node_modules/bulma/css/bulma.min.css css/bulma.min.css`
- This copies the pre-built Bulma CSS from where npm installed it into the `css/` directory that the HTML files reference

That's it. Every HTML file links to `/css/bulma.min.css` and `/css/custom.css` in the `<head>`, and the browser does the rest.

## Deployment (Netlify)

This project is deployed to Netlify. The configuration lives in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  publish = "."

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
```

### What each part does

**`[build]` section:**

- `command = "npm install && npm run build"` — On every deploy, Netlify runs this command. It installs the Bulma npm package, then copies `bulma.min.css` into the `css/` directory. This is necessary because `node_modules/` is git-ignored and not in the repository.
- `publish = "."` — Tells Netlify to serve the entire repo root as the website. There is no separate `dist/` or `build/` output folder — the HTML files live at the top level.

**`[[headers]]` section:**

- `for = "/*"` — Applies these HTTP headers to every route on the site.
- `X-Frame-Options = "DENY"` — Prevents the site from being embedded inside an `<iframe>` on another website. This is a security measure against clickjacking attacks.
- `X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"` — Tells browsers not to try to guess ("sniff") the content type of responses. This prevents certain types of attacks where a browser might misinterpret a file's type.

### Deploying

Push to the `main` branch on GitHub. If the repo is connected to Netlify, it will automatically build and deploy.

## Adding New Side Projects

The site currently has 3 project pages and supports up to 6 (displayed in a 3-column grid on the home page). To add a new project:

1. **Copy an existing project page:**
   ```bash
   cp projects/project-3.html projects/project-4.html
   ```

2. **Edit the new file** — update the project name, description, tech stack tags, features list, and placeholder image URL

3. **Add a card to `index.html`** — in the `#projects` section, add a new `<div class="column is-one-third">` block inside the `columns` div, following the same card pattern as the existing ones

4. **Add a navbar link** — in the navbar dropdown (in `index.html` and all project pages), add a new `<a class="navbar-item">` pointing to the new project page
